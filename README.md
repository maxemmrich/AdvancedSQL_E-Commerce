# Advanced SQL Analysis - E-Commerce

The analysis within this little project has been done using a sample database of an e-commerce shop. MySQL was used as a database system. My approach was to come up with some interesting business questions very close to real world applications and show a range of my SQL skills.

### Question 1: 
**How does the landing page /lander-1 perform against the /home page?** The database includes data on different campaigns and landing pages. I chose the bounce rate as an important metric to analyse. 
This are the results:

### Question 2: 
**How are the two billing pages /billing and /billing-2 performing?** The company did an A/B-test on two different billing pages. I analysed the conversion rate of these two.
This are the results:
